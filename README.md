# AerospaceDataPractice
Where I will be experimenting with aerospace data science.

## About
As a beginner programmer and current student of data science, I've created this repository for a few reasons:
   1. To learn more about GitHub
   2. To motivate myself to learn more
   3. To have somewhere to store my projects

The goal is to get better at programming and turn this into a sort of portfolio. 

## Code of Conduct
This is where I'm practicing, so I'm very open to critiques and suggestions. Just, please be respectful. I'm learning, so the expectation is that my code won't be perfect. 

```
"The universe doesn't allow perfection."
